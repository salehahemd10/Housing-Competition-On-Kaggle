# Housing-Competition-On-Kaggle
## Housing Price Prediction - Kaggle Competition
This repository contains a Machine Learning model developed for the Housing Price Prediction competition on Kaggle. The goal is to predict house prices based on various features using advanced data analysis and modeling techniques.

## Project Overview
 Dataset: The dataset includes multiple features affecting housing prices, such as location, number of rooms, and overall condition.
 Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values.
 Modeling: Multiple regression models were tested, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
 Performance: The best model was selected based on RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and overall prediction accuracy.

## Requirements
Python 
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
Jupyter Notebook
