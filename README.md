# Housing-Competition-On-Kaggle
Housing Price Prediction - Kaggle Competition
This repository contains a Machine Learning model developed for the Housing Price Prediction competition on Kaggle. The goal is to predict house prices based on various features using advanced data analysis and modeling techniques.

Project Overview
🏡 Dataset: The dataset includes multiple features affecting housing prices, such as location, number of rooms, and overall condition.
📊 Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values.
📈 Modeling: Multiple regression models were tested, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
🎯 Performance: The best model was selected based on RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and overall prediction accuracy.
